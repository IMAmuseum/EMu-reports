Making extensive use of technical documents such as X-radiographs, infrared reflectograms, and paint cross sections, it introduces visitors to the materials and working methods of the Renaissance painter and to modern scientific methods used to study artistic practices. An interactive Web site in the gallery provides more comprehensive information and documents the conservation treatment of one of Bellinis Madonnas.

The artists look to this device as one that simultaneously documents and erases immediate histories.\\In the Carmen & Mark Holeman Video Gallery adjacent to the balcony hall, RothStauffenberg's open-narrative collage, Schall und Rauch (*Smoke and Mirrors,* 2004-2006) is also on view. The German expression Schall und Rauch means *hollow words.* This installation incorporates simple, sometimes arbitrary, found materials, creating an environment of experiences that range in tone from poignant to disturbing to preposterous. The piece includes a multiple-part film (taken from found film footage) that then extends into the three-dimensional space of the room with a sequence of objects and imagery: a broken wall, a toy car, a movie poster. \\For the project at IMA, RothStauffenberg pieced together diverse recorded matter in order to consider the relationships between time, narrative, and memory. The artists use the black box, a device that records and forgets simultaneously, to produce a *screenplay* shaped by the machineries of memory and documentation. The *fourth dimension* of time is materially present in timecode, plastered across the gallery walls, which permeates the contextual environment of the galleries and extends the artwork into the lived experience of the audience.\\The Off the Wall project series invites emerging or experimental artists and artist groups to create new works for IMA. Off the Wall was inaugurated in November 2005, with the reopening of the contemporary galleries.",Internal,"","Rebecca Uchill","Rebecca Uchill",64335 | 64336 | 64337 | 64338 | 64339 | 64340 | 64341 | 64342

Ten actors were interviewed for this project. These individuals appear in their period attire and speak, both in historical character and as modern-day citizens of contemporary America. The cross-section of personas and historical contexts is complicated by rapid editing that produces a new narrative, with blurred temporal markers. The artist intends for his video installation to tell the story of a town whose residents are unmoored and floating somewhere in America, tethered neither to past or present, living in between reenactment, fiction and life.",Internal,"","Rebecca Uchill","Greg Smith",64873 | 64874 | 64875 | 64876 |

This exhibition looks at the use of adaptation in the recent work of four leading artists: Guy Ben-Ner, Arturo Herrera, Catherine Sullivan, and Eve Sussman & The Rufus Corporation. These artists have transformed source material to make their own adapted works of art, re-envisioning classic literature, film, ballet, e-mail, and painting as new video installations. For example, Ben-Ner condenses Herman Melville's Moby-Dick into a brief silent video made almost entirely in the artist's kitchen, while Sussman's feature-length The Rape of the Sabine Women transforms an eighteenth-century painting into an extended contemporary narrative. In six video installations adapted from source material, the exhibition addresses questions of fidelity and creativity while generating new understandings of the use of adaptation as a practice in contemporary art. The exhibition includes the United States museum premieres of The Rape of the Sabine Women and Les Noces, Herrera's first video installation. Les Noces will be shown in the Video Gallery.",Internal,"","Dr. Lisa Freiman","David Russick",67485 | 67481 | 67480 | 67482 | 67483 | 67484 | 67504 | 67503 | 67505 | 67506 | 67507 | 67509 | 67510 | 67511 | 67512 | 67513 | 67514 | 67518 | 67519 | 67520 | 67521 | 67522 | 67487 | 67486 | 67488 | 67490 | 67491 | 67492 | 67493 | 67494 | 67495 | 67496 | 67497 | 67498 | 67499 | 67544 | 67543 | 67545 | 67546 | 10048 | 7689 | 7690 | 67547 | 67548 | 67549 | 67550 | 67551 | 67552 | 67553 | 62481 | 67554 | 60120 | 60121 | 60122 | 62485 |

Levy's art deals with themes of memory, exploring the fleeting nature of individual experience, the similarities and differences between collective and personal acts of remembering, and how memories can be explicit or elusive. The installation will be comprised of a monumental *cloud* made from white plastic photo viewers that hang on strands of microfilament. The viewers are designed to be held up to the light to reveal an image inside. Each of the plastic viewers will contain a unique photograph, drawn from a collection of thousands of found 35mm slides that the artist has collected over the years throughout the Midwest. These photographs capture people posing for family snapshots, attending holiday events, working, enjoying vacations, or simply observing the world around them. In some areas, these viewers will be hung out of reach - suggesting a metaphor for experiences or memories that can not be retrieved - while in other areas they will be hung at a height that is accessible to visitors so that they can have the personal experience of peering through the viewers at these familiar yet mysterious images.\\Levy is an artist based in Kansas, who until recently lived and worked in Indianapolis.

Fast edited the video from conversations he recorded in Texas in 2006 with a young U.S. Army sergeant preparing to depart for his second tour in Iraq. The sergeant recounts two stories, which Fast splices and interweaves, blending the narrator's recollections of a date with a German woman while stationed in Bavaria, and the accidental shooting of a civilian in Iraq. The multi-layered account alternates between the two stories, with brief interruptions by a third narrative element of a film director asking questions of an actor at a casting.

The earliest engravings were line drawings transferred to the printing plate for reproduction. Later, many artists continued to work out their compositions as drawings before committing them to the permanence of the printed line. Noted artists provided professional printmakers with drawings or watercolors as models to be followed; other draftsmen found inspiration in printed images.

The flights to the moon represent an extreme form of human imagination and will - and an extraordinary leap of risk and faith. McCutcheon's works will reflect upon how the objects that we associate with these events are peculiarly modern yet nostalgic, highly technological yet fantastical. The exhibition will explore how this duality runs parallel to the man/boy conflict that exists in every father and son. The experience of the museum exhibition will be constructed to mimic a children's book narrative, beginning with a transformation of the real (a self-portrait of the artist as his son - a child/man) and an imaginative play with common things (a balloon chair).

The occasion marked the first time that the Pont-Aven School paintings and prints of Gauguin and his colleagues were publicly exhibited. The Volpini Suite one of the most important printmaking projects of 19th-century France, was Gauguin's first attempt at printmaking, and the prints reveal his rapid mastery of graphic techniques. The zincographs were created at a pivotal point in Gauguin's career, just a few months after the summer in Pont-Aven, when he developed the approach that characterizes his mature work.

They were followed by reportorial artists such as Frederic Remington and the photographer Edward Curtis intent on preserving artistically and romantically the disappearing frontier and Native American culture. As artists became residents of the west in the early 20th century, their perspective changed, with tidbits of local color replacing the grandiose prospect.\\This exhibition will bring 51 prints, drawings and photographs to the public, few of which have been shown before, including several never-displayed works by the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico.

When La Tour moved back to Indiana in 1940, she made her unusual collection available to the public free of charge in her Brown County farmhouse, which she called the Indiana Museum for Modern Art. In 1972, La Tour donated much of her collection, featuring figurative and abstract styles, to the IMA. This exhibition marks the first time many of her paintings, drawings, and prin have been displayed since their days in Brown County. The Indiana University Art Museum is also lending four works from La Tours collection.\\Installation begins on 10/13/2014.",Internal,"","Ellen Lee","Phil Lynam",27676 | 5881 | 6549 | 17998 | 18905 | 15626 | 82247 | 42983 | 25383 | 42987 | 51368 | 81337 | 81338 | 81336 | 81325 | 42972 | 42995 | 42961 | 42996 | 51326 | 85011 | 85016 | 85019 | 85021 | 82230

On walks to the woods, McCartney would stop to look at birds, but didn’t attempt to document them. They were always too far away, moving too quickly and never landed in the appropriate composition. She then decided to take control and bought her own birds to create the idealized scenes of her fantasies, where songbirds perched patiently on trees as she photographed them. The resulting photographs explore the idea of constructed landscapes and intrinsic value of natural vs. fabricated experiences. In McCartney’s work the birds act as decoration, making the landscapes more interesting, but ultimately presenting false representations of the natural world.",Internal,"","Scott Stulen","",89872 | 89873 | 89874 | 89875 | 89876 | 89877 | 89878 | 89879 | 89880 | 89881 | 89882 | 89883 | 89884 | 89885 | 89886 | 89887 | 89888 | 89889 | 94527

The crazy quilt fad emerged as a response to the Japanese-influenced Aesthetic movement, which embraced asymmetry and bold colors and made the structured patterns of traditional quilts seem outdated. Crazy quilts were patched using irregular pieces of fabrics without a specific design, and the seams were embroidered in a variety of decorative techniques and styles. Motifs, including flowers, animals, figures, fans, moons and stars, and other symbols were embroidered or painted to further personalize the quilts and even memorialize people or events. The quilts incorporated a wide range of “fancy” fabrics, including silks, velvets, wool, printed cottons, scraps from clothes with sentimental meaning, and commemorative ribbons. Noteworthy quilts in the exhibition feature portraits printed on fabric, possibly to commemorate loved ones. \\The exhibition will trace the brief history of this unique style of quilt in the context of the period’s increasing industrialization-when elaborate  fabrics were more widely available-and other decorative arts movements, provide insight into the symbolism of late 1800s motifs, and explore how women expressed their creativity through crazy quilts.",Internal,"","Niloo Imami-Paydar","Lara Huchteman",5324 | 35961 | 32092 | 1659 | 36674 | 26987 | 29597 | 89786 | 89787 | 89803 | 89802 | 89804 | 90518

By the mid 1970s, this group became collectively known as “The Chicago Imagists”.  Their instantly recognizable, highly expressive style is unique and sets their work apart from contemporary art that was produced on the East or West Coasts.  Now, more than 50 years after their first shows, the Chicago Imagists are regarded as among the most important post-war American artists.\\The Robertson-Slapak collection is one of the most comprehensive private collections of Chicago Imagist art, possessing key pieces from each of the Imagist artists.

The images of rain, snow, wind, or even fine weather are evocative to the extent that the viewer feels the need to rush for shelter in the pouring downpour, or to hunch one’s shoulders and cover up as much as possible when shelter is unavailable. Or, as in the image of the great pine tree on a rainy night, one can visually “hear” the sound of a steady summer downpour while enjoying the added lyrical sentiments of the accompanying poem—emotionally and psychologically placing oneself deeper into the scene. \\This exhibition features four masterworks by Hiroshige featuring rain: \1)	Shono, Sudden Downpour, from the 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō series, is considered one of Hiroshige’s greatest masterpieces. \2)	Evening Shower on the Great Bridge and Atake, as is well known, inspired Vincent Van Gogh to make a copy. \3)	The Night Rain at Karasaki, part of the hugely popular series, The Eight Views of Ōmi, is an iconic print that inspired successive generations of Japanese artists.\4)	The Tsuchiyama is presented in two impressions that allow for comparison and discussion of connoisseurship issues—especially in the printing of the rain.\\Also for comparison purposes, a work by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, the great late Edo-Meiji period master,  is included in the exhibition.\\Moreover, three 20c works demonstrate Hiroshige’s lasting influence into modern times.",Internal,"","John Teramoto","",17635 | 31667 | 16761 | 33492 | 11804 | 71836 | 25186 | 82677 | 52526
