This installation of three paintings from the IMA's collection focuses on the practice of painting in Bellini's workshop, with particular emphasis on how images of the Madonna and Child were created and copied to meet the needs of private devotion.  Making extensive use of technical documents such as X-radiographs, infrared reflectograms, and paint cross sections, it introduces visitors to the materials and working methods of the Renaissance painter and to modern scientific methods used to study artistic practices.  An interactive Web site in the gallery provides more comprehensive information and documents the conservation treatment of one of Bellini's Madonnas.  This installation is accompanied by a scholarly publication, Giovanni Bellini and the Art of Devotion, edited by IMA curator Ronda Kasl.  Funding is provided by the Samuel H.

3749,132,Yes,EX2007.10,Exhibition,Completed,Off the Wall:  RothStauffenberg,"The German artists Christopher Roth and Franz Stauffenberg create multi-media environments out of found text, film, and objects-including elements of prior artworks ""remixed"" in new formats. The artists have worked together since 1989, adopting the name RothStauffenberg in the year 2000.

In this exhibition, RothStauffenberg adapted a number of existing pieces particularly for the Indianapolis Museum of Art. The four artworks in the Off the Wall Gallery illustrate the artists' idea of ""in-between"" time. Their Timecoded Wallpaper (1995-2006) is accompanied by a series of works called Pacific Ocean, 1969 (2000), all of which are based on airplane ""black box"" recordings. Cockpit voice recorders perpetually record sound, erasing older material in the process. The artists look to this device as one that simultaneously documents and erases immediate histories.

In the Carmen & Mark Holeman Video Gallery adjacent to the balcony hall, RothStauffenberg's open-narrative collage, Schall und Rauch (""Smoke and Mirrors,"" 2004-2006) is also on view. The German expression Schall und Rauch means ""hollow words."" This installation incorporates simple, sometimes arbitrary, found materials, creating an environment of experiences that range in tone from poignant to disturbing to preposterous. The piece includes a multiple-part film (taken from found film footage) that then extends into the three-dimensional space of the room with a sequence of objects and imagery: a broken wall, a toy car, a movie poster. 

For the project at IMA, RothStauffenberg pieced together diverse recorded matter in order to consider the relationships between time, narrative, and memory. The artists use the black box, a device that records and forgets simultaneously, to produce a ""screenplay"" shaped by the machineries of memory and documentation. The ""fourth dimension"" of time is materially present in timecode, plastered across the gallery walls, which permeates the contextual environment of the galleries and extends the artwork into the lived experience of the audience.

The Off the Wall project series invites emerging or experimental artists and artist groups to create new works for IMA. Off the Wall was inaugurated in November 2005, with the reopening of the contemporary galleries.",Internal,1/26/2007,9/2/2007,,9/12/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten actors were interviewed for this project. These individuals appear in their period attire and speak, both in historical character and as modern-day citizens of contemporary America. The cross-section of personas and historical contexts is complicated by rapid editing that produces a new narrative, with blurred temporal markers. The artist intends for his video installation to tell the story of a town whose residents are unmoored and floating somewhere in America, tethered neither to past or present, living in between reenactment, fiction and life.",Internal,9/28/2007,3/2/2008,,12/1/2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Created in Paris during the Belle poque -- the last decades of the 19th-century and the years leading up to World War I -- posters by these artists and others were so popular that the publishers printed overruns to sell to collectors.

At once abstract and representational, these works serve to document an intimate record of pedestrian life. Calames new show at the IMA marks a shift in subject matter as the artist and her team visited the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in October 2006, tracing tire tracks, skid marks, and oil stain found on the world-renowned racetrack. Over the course of 12 months, the artist transformed these tracings into large-scale color pencil drawings, enamel-on-aluminum paintings, and one latex

The objects chosen for the exhibition were created explicitly to arouse wonder, devotion, and identification, resulting in art of enormous power and originality. Sacred Spain will include works of art in all media, including paintings by well-known artists such as El Greco, Velzquez, Zurbarn and Murillo, as well as less well-known masterpieces of polychrome sculpture, liturgical silver, embroidered vestments and illuminated manuscripts.

This exhibition looks at the use of adaptation in the recent work of four leading artists: Guy Ben-Ner, Arturo Herrera, Catherine Sullivan, and Eve Sussman & The Rufus Corporation. These artists have transformed source material to make their own adapted works of art, re-envisioning classic literature, film, ballet, e-mail, and painting as new video installations. For example, Ben-Ner condenses Herman Melville's Moby-Dick into a brief silent video made almost entirely in the artist's kitchen, while Sussman's feature-length The Rape of the Sabine Women transforms an eighteenth-century painting into an extended contemporary narrative. In six video installations adapted from source material, the exhibition addresses questions of fidelity and creativity while generating new understandings of the use of adaptation as a practice in contemporary art. The exhibition includes the United States museum premieres of The Rape of the Sabine Women and Les Noces, Herrera's first video installation. Les Noces will be shown in the Video Gallery.",Internal,5/8/2009,8/16/2009,,2/18/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IMA conservation department has been working to bring these murals back to their original condition since 2004, when they conserved a painting by Indiana African American artist William Edouard Scott.  Since then, the conservation of several works by such Indiana artists as T. C. Steele, Clifton Wheeler, J. Ottis Adams, and Wayman Adams has been completed.

For centuries, delicate forms and rich colors of flowers have captivated artists and designers alike. Using roses, poppies, petunias, peonies, chrysanthemums and wildflowers, artists gave life to the simplest of silhouettes. The floral patterns on these garments were executed in a range of techniques including printing, embroidery, beading and brocading. Among the designers whose work will be exhibited are Norman Norell, Bill Blass, Givenchy, Galanos, Trigere and Callot Soeurs. Fashion in Bloom offers an in-depth look at the major styles of Western fashion, by providing a framework of significant shifts in silhouettes of feminine attire from the late 1700s to 1970s.",Internal,4/4/2009,1/31/2010,,2/18/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His method includes the use of shellac, torn and crumpled papers, dyes and other materials in conjunction with wood blocks to create low reliefs and complex surface textures. A notable feature of his work is his subtle color harmonies at times combined with strikingly contrasting colors to create a luminescent glow to his works.

3821,3825,Yes,EX2009.15,Exhibition,Completed,Judith G. Levy: Memory Cloud,"Judith G. Levy's art deals with themes of memory, exploring the fleeting nature of individual experience, the similarities and differences between collective and personal acts of remembering, and how memories can be explicit or elusive. The installation will be comprised of a monumental ""cloud"" made from white plastic photo viewers that hang on strands of microfilament. The viewers are designed to be held up to the light to reveal an image inside. Each of the plastic viewers will contain a unique photograph, drawn from a collection of thousands of found 35mm slides that the artist has collected over the years throughout the Midwest. These photographs capture people posing for family snapshots, attending holiday events, working, enjoying vacations, or simply observing the world around them. In some areas, these viewers will be hung out of reach - suggesting a metaphor for experiences or memories that can not be retrieved - while in other areas they will be hung at a height that is accessible to visitors so that they can have the personal experience of peering through the viewers at these familiar yet mysterious images.

Levy is an artist based in Kansas, who until recently lived and worked in Indianapolis. Her work incorporates a variety of mediums, including drawing, sculpture, video and performance.  Levy's installation in the Efroymson Family Pavilion will be her first major solo museum exhibition, and will feature a work specially commissioned for the IMA.",Internal,7/10/2009,1/24/2010,,2/18/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fast edited the video from conversations he recorded in Texas in 2006 with a young U.S. Army sergeant preparing to depart for his second tour in Iraq. The sergeant recounts two stories, which Fast splices and interweaves, blending the narrator's recollections of a date with a German woman while stationed in Bavaria, and the accidental shooting of a civilian in Iraq. The multi-layered account alternates between the two stories, with brief interruptions by a third narrative element of a film director asking questions of an actor at a casting. From one side of the room, the two screens display the sergeant speaking to Fast in the original interview, while from the opposite side the screens silently depict actors performing the same script.",Internal,9/11/2009,2/21/2010,,2/18/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The videos in this exhibition, 0% Down (2008) and Mall of America (2009), crystallize many of the core issues that Meckseper has explored through her works in other media, using imagery appropriated from advertising and documentary footage of a shopping mall to create aesthetically seductive yet challenging works. Alternately displayed on opposite walls of the video gallery, this pair of works is visually stimulating in the contrasting visual strategies represented - one work filmed black-and-white with intense sound, the other drenched in vivid colors with a haunting ambient soundtrack - and presents a dynamic dialogue about the connections between politics and consumerism in contemporary life.",Internal,10/16/2009,2/7/2010,,9/12/2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through a variety of movements, procedures, and performances, the artists in ""Framed"" investigate the space between self and environment, self and other, and the divide between what is recorded by a camera and the indefinite expanse of unmediated life. Each video depicts the artist as he or she marks, follows, or grapples with a boundary and thereby maps the space of a now-expanded studio, still encompassing the familiar territory of four-walled artist's studio, but also stretching into the street, city, and wider surroundings.

To help manage his highly successful career as a commercial illustrator, Warhol formed Andy Warhol Enterprises, Inc. in 1957. The aesthetic approach, techniques and business acumen he developed during that time informed his artistic production from the early 1960s until his death in 1987. Throughout his career as an artist, filmmaker, ""Factory"" director, band manager, magazine publisher and television entrepreneur, Warhol intentionally blurred the line between art and commerce, slyly calling into question the very values of art itself in such statements as ""Good business is the best art.""
 
The exhibition will examine works from each of the major decades of Warhol's artistic career, from his commercial illustrations and shop window designs of the 1950s, to his groundbreaking paintings and sculptures of consumer products and stars of the 1960s, to his commissioned portraiture and entrepreneurial ventures into various media, such as magazines, film and TV, in the 1970s and 1980s.",Internal,10/10/2010,1/2/2011,,10/2/2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The earliest engravings were line drawings transferred to the printing plate for reproduction. Later, many artists continued to work out their compositions as drawings before committing them to the permanence of the printed line. Noted artists provided professional printmakers with drawings or watercolors as models to be followed; other draftsmen found inspiration in printed images. In the 20th century, original prints were apt to be extensions of the painter-printmakers' personal drawing styles.

3857,3862,Yes,EX2011.5,Exhibition,Completed,Brian McCutcheon: Out of This World,"Brian McCutcheon is an Indianapolis-based conceptual artist who works with a variety of mediums, including drawing, sculpture, video, and photography. This exhibition is McCutcheon's first major solo exhibition, and features a new group of works specially commissioned by the IMA. The show will include three-dimensional renderings and objects that explore themes relative to the Apollo Missions to the Moon and how those events articulated American ideas of masculinity. The flights to the moon represent an extreme form of human imagination and will - and an extraordinary leap of risk and faith. McCutcheon's works will reflect upon how the objects that we associate with these events are peculiarly modern yet nostalgic, highly technological yet fantastical. The exhibition will explore how this duality runs parallel to the man/boy conflict that exists in every father and son. The experience of the museum exhibition will be constructed to mimic a children's book narrative, beginning with a transformation of the real (a self-portrait of the artist as his son - a child/man) and an imaginative play with common things (a balloon chair).  As one moves through the exhibition, it will evolve as an imaginative narrative related to the Apollo missions, including the launch, space travel, and lunar landing, before arriving at the theme of the splash down - the return to reality.",Internal,9/9/2011,3/4/2012,,10/1/2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fundamentally based on Buddhist thought, Tawara's vision of reality was transformed into richly complex paintings filled with monumental energy that makes it difficult to believe some may be as small as 3 x 5 inches. His paintings are intriguing and beautiful, executed primarily in ink on paper. Constructed from countless strokes and dots using small brushes and other improvised implements, the paintings have an intensity of content and visual impact. Tawara eschewed representational art, though many of his paintings are reminiscent of ink landscapes or other forms in nature. Though Tawara utilized long-favored symbols of Zen calligraphy (he also made use of the Western alphabet), he emphasized that he was not trying to do calligraphy. Essentially he took motifs often employed in calligraphy and painted them -- constructed them -- creating exciting effects that could never be executed in a single stroke.",Internal,11/11/2011,6/10/2012,,2/18/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The portfolio of 11 zincographs printed on canary yellow paper was nicknamed ""Volpini"" after the owner of the Caf des Arts in Paris, where the prints were presented during the summer of 1889. The occasion marked the first time that the Pont-Aven School paintings and prints of Gauguin and his colleagues were publicly exhibited. The Volpini Suite one of the most important printmaking projects of 19th-century France, was Gauguin's first attempt at printmaking, and the prints reveal his rapid mastery of graphic techniques. The zincographs were created at a pivotal point in Gauguin's career, just a few months after the summer in Pont-Aven, when he developed the approach that characterizes his mature work. The images represent Gauguin's thematic interests as well as his travels to Brittany, Arles, and Martinique, and their subjects, motifs, and style offer fascinating points of comparisons to the work Gauguin would create during the rest of his life.",Internal,3/11/2011,9/18/2011,,2/18/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were followed by reportorial artists such as Frederic Remington and the photographer Edward Curtis intent on preserving artistically and romantically the disappearing frontier and Native American culture. As artists became residents of the west in the early 20th century, their perspective changed, with tidbits of local color replacing the grandiose prospect.

The artists in the Pont-Aven School were drawn to the rugged landscape of Brittany, and the colorful traditions of the Breton people provided a continual source of inspiration. Although the Pont-Aven artists appreciated the isolation of Brittany, they also reveled in the intellectual and social life of Paris in the 1880s and 1890s. The prints gathered in the exhibition reveal the affinity that Pont-Aven School artists felt for the pleasures and entertainments of modern urban life, which provided an alternative to the nostalgic, rural Breton themes for which they are primarily known.",Internal,2/7/2012,8/22/2012,,2/18/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the IMA currently holds very few significant examples of American silver, several private collectors are in discussion with the museum to lend and potentially donate major examples of American silver to the IMAs permanent collection. Combining exceptional works from the three private collections (two from Indianapolis and one from Seattle) and the few strong pieces from the IMA, American Silver, 1850-1930 will trace the development of American silver over eight decades.The show would start with silver in the gothic revival and naturalistic styles created in relatively small silversmith shops in the 1850s and end with pieces made in the art deco taste of  the 1920s by huge companies. Along with design history, fine examples of silver in a wide variety of styles will illustrate changes in etiquette, dining history, the role of women, and manufacturing over eighty years.

Fear of missing out, or FOMO, is a form of social anxiety, whereby one is compulsively concerned about missing an opportunity for social interaction, a novel experience, a profitable investment or other satisfying event. Through an increased reliance on the Internet, a psychological dependence on being online has developed and results in feeling disconnected, thereby leading to a fear of missing out. The term is shortened to the hashtag #FOMO and used colloquially by digital generations to refer to missing out on something significant you don't do something/participate in an event. The Fear of Missing Out exhibition takes a playful spin on this ailment, by making the gallery a site for constantly evolving ephemeral, interactive and collaborative experiences. But unlike the condition, the exhibition will examine how the physical context of the gallery can frame relevant and meaningful connections to both art and life, and not just social media fueled spectacle.

Crazy quilts, made by women as a leisurely pursuit and used as decorative parlor  throws, were extremely popular throughout the United States in the 1880s and 1890s. The crazy quilt fad emerged as a response to the Japanese-influenced Aesthetic movement, which embraced asymmetry and bold colors and made the structured patterns of traditional quilts seem outdated. Crazy quilts were patched using irregular pieces of fabrics without a specific design, and the seams were embroidered in a variety of decorative techniques and styles. Motifs, including flowers, animals, figures, fans, moons and stars, and other symbols were embroidered or painted to further personalize the quilts and even memorialize people or events. The quilts incorporated a wide range of  fancy  fabrics, including silks, velvets, wool, printed cottons, scraps from clothes with sentimental meaning, and commemorative ribbons. Noteworthy quilts in the exhibition feature portraits printed on fabric, possibly to commemorate loved ones. 

The exhibition will trace the brief history of this unique style of quilt in the context of the period s increasing industrialization-when elaborate  fabrics were more widely available-and other decorative arts movements, provide insight into the symbolism of late 1800s motifs, and explore how women expressed their creativity through crazy quilts.",Internal,5/5/2017,1/7/2018,,1/17/2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or, as in the image of the great pine tree on a rainy night, one can visually  hear  the sound of a steady summer downpour while enjoying the added lyrical sentiments of the accompanying poem emotionally and psychologically placing oneself deeper into the scene. 

This exhibition features four masterworks by Hiroshige featuring rain: 
1)	Shono, Sudden Downpour, from the 53 Stations of the TMkaidM series, is considered one of Hiroshige s greatest masterpieces. 
2)	Evening Shower on the Great Bridge and Atake, as is well known, inspired Vincent Van Gogh to make a copy. 
3)	The Night Rain at Karasaki, part of the hugely popular series, The Eight Views of Lmi, is an iconic print that inspired successive generations of Japanese artists.
4)	The Tsuchiyama is presented in two impressions that allow for comparison and discussion of connoisseurship issues especially in the printing of the rain.

By always working with fruit as a material or media, the catalogue of projects and works reimagine public interactions with the margins of urban space, systems of community and narrative real-time experience. Fallen Fruit s visual work includes an ongoing series of art installations, wallpapers, public fruit parks, and video works that explore the social and political implications of our relationship to fruit and world around us. Recent curatorial projects reindex the social and historical complexities of museums and archives by re-installing permanent collections through syntactical relationships of fruit as subject.

For Harvest 2021, I propose engaging Fallen Fruit to conduct a socially oriented research project to map the presence of fruit trees in public space in Indianapolis. In addition to a mapping project, I propose a community engagement project in partnership with Indy Parks and the City of Indianapolis in which fruit trees are planted in public spaces, focusing on public spaces within identified food deserts. These trees will eventually produce fruit that will be freely available to passersby.",,,,Cancelled,4/21/2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work will be developed internally by the Newfields Lab (Daniel Keller, lead developer), to tie in with and build anticipation for Newfields  eclipse celebration. 

We anticipate this work to have a runtime of 3-6 minutes, likely incorporating 3D assets from NASA s Scientific Visualization Studio (e.g., https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4720) to create an artistic visual representation of a solar eclipse in space, set/synced to instrumental music that will play in the courtyard. Together, these elements will provide an immersive experience that guests have come to expect in the Clowes Courtyard. 

This is not a project that has been previously budgeted for a standalone project, but expenses should be covered within the eclipse project budget. Costs will be minimal.

The sculpture, Capsule, re-imagines the historic Mercury space capsule Friendship 7 that in 1962 launched astronaut John Glenn into orbit around the Earth.

The period between the end of the portraits exhibition and the reopening of the Clowes Pavilion (August 19, 2019   spring 2021) will be proposed separately.

This plan is on the condition that there is no Masterpiece Tour, which would include the bulk of the European paintings collection (both Clowes and non-Clowes works). Until we are certain that the tour will take place, we need to proceed with plans for what will happen if there is no tour.

In order to highlight the importance of certain works, and to emphasize their connection to others within gallery H214, I would like to incorporate a design element similar to what we ve done for the American decorative arts gallery (H203): a colored  pop-out  section of the wall behind the Rubens sketch (2001.237) and the Brueghel landscape (2000.343).

Dear All, 
As some of you know, in the past few months and now over the holidays, I have had several conversations with key lenders that will necessitate changes in our silver gallery H205.
In brief, Richard Bressler has finalized his estate planning and we now know what silver he is going to donate to the IMA and which pieces he is going to either sell or leave to his children.  This will mean that we need to return a few pieces to him this spring and pick up two from his Seattle residence for shipment to the IMA. 
Steven and Karen Chambless have sent additional pieces on loan from their spectacular collection, which need to be worked into the installation.  Some of their new loans will need polishing.
Several local collectors have also acquired very fine pieces that are now promised to the IMA and need to be installed as well. 
Attached please find an outline of the changes that need to be made in H205.  I fully realize that rotations should ideally be planned much further in advance, but we need to move quickly to accommodate Mr. Bressler s desire to finalize his estate planning and to entice the Chambless  to begin making gifts to the IMA.    
Therefore, I suggest we gather together the required individuals and review these needed changes very soon so that we can get them accomplished as early in 2020 as possible.  Once we have a timeline I can inform the donors/lenders as to when they can come to Indianapolis and see their pieces in the gallery.",,8/28/2020,,,9/4/2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,
