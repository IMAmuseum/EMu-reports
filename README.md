# EMu Reports
Custom reports created for the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields collection management system, EMu. These reports were designed to meet specific one-time or ongoing needs of Newfields' Registration and Curatorial staff.

Reports maintained in this repository are all XSLT report formats, created to output HTML as either page views within the EMu modules or as stand-alone reports to be printed as PDFs. Reports are separated into two directories based on their intention, and further broken down into EMu module on which the report is run:

- Page views (viewed within EMu)
- Reports (opened in browser automatically after running)

In the case of reports to be viewed outside of the application, PDF versions of the reports have been included along with the XSLT. Where necessary, information in the reports is redacted.
